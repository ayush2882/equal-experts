# Equal Experts Assignment

1. Understand the problem statement.

 `The problem statement is to write a HTTP web server API that will fetch a GitHub user's public gists via the GitHub API.` 
 `The API is implemented using Flask and packaged into a Docker container.`

2. Setup and Run Instructions

    2(a) Prerequisites:-

    - Docker installed on local
    - Python installed on local
    - Git installed on local

    2(b) Cloning the Git Repo:

    `git clone git@github.com:EqualExperts-Assignments/equal-experts-profuse-ethical-clean-plan-0d124cb93304.git`
    `cd equal-experts-profuse-ethical-clean-plan-0d124cb93304`
    
3. Installing dependencies: Put the dependencies(Flask, requests in this case) in requirements.txt file.

4. Installing dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

5. Running the app locally - `python3 app.py`

6. Created test cases which would handle a valid and invalid user.

7. Run the test cases - `python3 -m unittest test_app.py`

8. Created a Docker file to dockerize the above service.

9. Building the docker image - `docker build -t ayush2882/equal-experts-image .`

10. Running the container - `docker run -p 8080:8080 ayush2882/equal-experts-image`

11. Checking response for valid and invalid users:

    a. Octocat: `curl http://localhost:8080/octocat`

    `[{"description":"Hello world!","id":"6cad326836d38bd3a7ae","url":"https://gist.github.com/octocat/6cad326836d38bd3a7ae"},{"description":"","id":"0831f3fbd83ac4d46451","url":"https://gist.github.com/octocat/0831f3fbd83ac4d46451"},{"description":"","id":"2a6851cde24cdaf4b85b","url":"https://gist.github.com/octocat/2a6851cde24cdaf4b85b"},{"description":"Some common .gitignore configurations","id":"9257657","url":"https://gist.github.com/octocat/9257657"},{"description":null,"id":"1305321","url":"https://gist.github.com/octocat/1305321"},{"description":null,"id":"1169854","url":"https://gist.github.com/octocat/1169854"},{"description":null,"id":"1169852","url":"https://gist.github.com/octocat/1169852"},{"description":null,"id":"1162032","url":"https://gist.github.com/octocat/1162032"}]`

    b. Invalid User: `curl http://localhost:8080/nonexistentuser123`
    
    `{"error":"User not found or GitHub API error"}`

    c. Robert: `curl http://localhost:8080/robert`
